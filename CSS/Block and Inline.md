# Block vs inline
default style is display: Block
**Inline** 
- do not start on new line. 
- Appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside.
- A Tag (link) is a inline
	- in general do not try to put extra padding or margin on inline elements
## middle ground inline-block
inline block behaves like inline elements
- Not used that much
- Most likely will be using flex box instead
## Divs and Spans
- Most often purpose is to "hook" elements. Give ID or class to target for styling with CSS
- Grouping related elements under one parent element to correctly position
DIV
- Block  level
- Group other elements
- divide page into different blocks
Span
- Group text content and inline HTML elements for styling,
- Should only be used when no other semantic HTML is appropriate
